# ableton-live-html5-control-surface
Web-based control surface for Ableton Live

This is the first public release of this project, in a pre-alpha stage. This early version is mostly intended for developers curious about how it was done and willing to give feedback or collaborate. Deployment instructions will follow soon, and hopefully it will become a product usable for any ableton live user at some point, but there is still much work to be done.
